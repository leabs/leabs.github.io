I worked through the webpack getting started guide found here: [https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/ "https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/")

My github repo can be found <a href="[https://github.com/leabs/learning-webpack](https://github.com/leabs/learning-webpack "https://github.com/leabs/learning-webpack")" target="_blank">here</a>.

Pretty easy to set up and use.
